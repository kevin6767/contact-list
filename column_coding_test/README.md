# Description

Using React, I created a small project that showcases my skills using React. This app allows the user to open a contact list, which includes a picture, first and last name, and potientally 2 phone numbers. I got this data using a random API generator and just placing it in its own JSON file. Which you open the contact list, you can click on any part of the contacts and the app will give you their phone number(s).

# Liscenses

# Usages

I will be using this project strictly to improve my knowledge further of React, and showcase my abilitys.

# Installation
